# nato-phonetic-alphabet-converter
 This script converts a user-input word into NATO phonetic alphabet code words. It reads data from nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv, creates a dictionary mapping each letter to its phonetic code, and translates the user's word using this dictionary. Output is a list of phonetic code words for each letter in the input word.
